DEPRECATION WARNING: The behavior of `changed_attributes` inside of after callbacks will be changing in the next version of Rails. The new return value will reflect the behavior of calling the method after `save` returned (e.g. the opposite of what it returns now). To maintain the current behavior, use `saved_changes.transform_values(&:first)` instead. (called from format_tags at /home/andrew/workspace/ahobooru/app/models/post.rb:14)

DEPRECATION WARNING: The behavior of `changed_attributes` inside of after callbacks will be changing in the next version of Rails. The new return value will reflect the behavior of calling the method after `save` returned (e.g. the opposite of what it returns now). To maintain the current behavior, use `saved_changes.transform_values(&:first)` instead. (called from format_tags at /home/andrew/workspace/ahobooru/app/models/post.rb:14)
